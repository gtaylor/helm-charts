## Prerequesites

Before installing this Chart, you'll need the following:

1. A Tailscale account.
2. A reusable [auth key](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/).
3. A Kubernetes Secret in the Namespace that you'll installing this Chart in.
4. It's probably worth briefly reading the upstream [Subnet + Kubernetes](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/tree/main/docs/k8s#subnet-router) instructions from which this Chart was based on.

## A note on secrets

This Chart does not expose a value to pass your Tailscale auth keys in, as the author populates these via other means (the Vault CSI driver).

Whether you manually create it or sync it in via other means (Vault, Sealed Secrets, etc), a Secret will need to exist in your target namespace before installing the Chart.

Unless overridden, the Chart will assume that you have a Secret named `tailscale-subnet-router-secrets` whose `AUTH_KEY` key contains your router's Tailscale auth key.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add gtaylor https://gtaylor.github.io/helm-charts
$ helm install my-release gtaylor/tailscale-subnet-router \
    --set image.repository your-repo-here.com/tailscale/tailscale-subnet-proxy \
```

If all goes well, you should see a new Subnet router in your Tailscale admin page.

**Note: You'll need to enable the routes and disable key expiry on the newly created host entry in the Tailscale admin page.**

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

**Tip: Make sure to revoke your auth key in Tailscale afterwards.**
